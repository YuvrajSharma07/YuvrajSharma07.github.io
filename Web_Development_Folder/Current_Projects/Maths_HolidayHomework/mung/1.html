            <div class="innercon"> Sitting firmly at the top of many traveler's wish lists, the Taj Mahal in India is a delight for tourists, with many waiting to get that iconic photo in front of this beautiful building. But look closer and you'll find a great example of line symmetry &#45; with two lines, one vertical down the middle of the Taj, and one along the waterline, showing the reflection of the prayer towers in the water.<br><br>

            <div class="conhead">Chichen Itza</div><br>
            <div class="innercon">
               Chichen Itza was built by the Maya Civilization, who were known as fantastic mathematicians, credited with the inventing 'zero' within their counting system. At 78 feet tall, the structure of El Castillo (or 'castle') within Chichen Itza is based on the astrological system.<br><br>
               Some fast facts: the fifty two panels on each side of the pyramid represent the number of years in the Mayan cycle, the stairways dividing the eighteen tiers correspond to the Mayan calendar of eighteen months and the steps within El Castillo mirror the solar year, with a total of 365 steps, one step for each day of the year.

            <div class="conhead">Great Pyramids of Giza</div><br>
            <div class="innercon">
                We all know this monument as one of the 7 wonders of the world. But did you know that in cubits, the pyramid's perimeter is 365.24 &#45; the number of days in a year? Or did you know that if the pyramid's perimeter is divided by twice its height, its equal to pi (3.1416)?<br><br>
                Well probably you didn't know these facts earlier, but now that you know, share them with your friends.

            <div class="conhead">The Gherkin</div><br>
            <div class="innercon">
                The Gherkin's unusual design features &#45; the round building, bulge in the middle, the narrow taper at the top and spiraling design &#45; create an impact in more ways than you might think. The cylindrical shape minimizes whirlwinds that can form at the base of large buildings, something that can be predicted by computer modeling using the math of turbulence.
