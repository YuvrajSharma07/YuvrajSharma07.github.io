                    Simulated reality is the hypothesis that reality could be simulated (for example by computer simulation) to a degree indistinguishable from "true" reality. It could contain conscious minds which may or may not be fully aware that they are living inside a simulation. Which, in simple words, means that simulated reality is a theory which states that the reality in which we are in currently, is in fact simulated.<br><br>
                    Even though, simulated reality is quite different from the concept of virtual reality. Virtual reality is easily distinguished from the experience of actuality; participants are never in doubt about the nature of what they experience. Simulated reality, by contrast, would be hard or impossible to separate from "true" reality.

                <div class="content p1 p2">
                    A dream could be considered a type of simulation capable of fooling someone who is asleep. As a result, the "dream hypothesis" cannot be ruled out, although it has been argued that common sense and considerations of simplicity rule against it. Which, in simple words, means that our dreams can be considered a type of simulation, which have a potential to fool who someone is asleep. One of the first philosophers to question the distinction between reality and dreams was <a class="picinfo" onclick="getElementById('picinfo').style.display = 'block'">Zhuangzi</a>, a Chinese philosopher from the 4th century BC. He phrased the problem as the well-known "Butterfly Dream," which went as follows:<br><br>
                    <div class="outter outpix" id="picinfo">
                    <div class="inner zoom">
                        <div class="innerhead blue"><h2>Zhuangzi<span class="closebtn" onclick="getElementById('picinfo').style.display = 'none'">&times;</span></h2></div>
                        <div class="innerbod">
                        <img src="Media/zhuangzi.jpg">
                        </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <i class="italic">Once Zhuangzi dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn't know he was Zhuangzi. Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable Zhuangzi. But he didn't know if he was Zhuangzi who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuangzi. Between Zhuangzi and a butterfly there must be some distinction! This is called the Transformation of Things. (2, tr. Burton Watson 1968:49)</i><br><br>
                    The philosophical underpinnings of this argument are also brought up by Descartes, who was one of the first Western philosophers to do so. In Meditations on First Philosophy, he states "... there are no certain indications by which we may clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep", and goes on to conclude that "It is possible that I am dreaming right now and that all of my perceptions are false".

                The simulation hypothesis was first published by <a class="picinfo" onclick="getElementById('picinfo1').style.display = 'block'">Hans Moravec</a>. Later, the philosopher <a class="picinfo" onclick="getElementById('picinfo2').style.display = 'block'">Nick Bostrom</a> developed an expanded argument examining the probability of our reality being a simulacrum. His argument states that at least one of the following statements is very likely to be true:<br>

                    Epistemologically, it is not impossible to tell whether we are living in a simulation. For example, Bostrom suggests that a window could pop up saying: "You are living in a simulation. Click here for more information." However, imperfections in a simulated environment might be difficult for the native inhabitants to identify, and for purposes of authenticity, even the simulated memory of a blatant revelation might be purged programmatically. Nonetheless, should any evidence come to light, either for or against the skeptical hypothesis, it would radically alter the aforementioned probability.
