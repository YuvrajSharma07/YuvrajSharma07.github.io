<h2>DD Full Screen Slider</h2>
<p id="intro" class="scrollable">This full screen Slider creates slides that cover the entire page, allowing you to present content in an interactive, digestible format to viewers. Desktop and mobile friendly, the slides can be navigated in a plethora of ways- auto generated navigational buttons, keyboard, mousewheel, and drag/swipe on the desktop and on mobile. Each slide adds an unique hash (#) to the window URL to make them navigable and sharable with distinct URLs. Unique amongst its features is the ability to enable "scrollable" DIVs inside a slide that do not partake in the scrolling of the slide itself when swiped, so the content in question can be scrolled instead. Full Screen Slider harnesses CSS3 for its animations, falling back to jQuery for older browsers.</p>
