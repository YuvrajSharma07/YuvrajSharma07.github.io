		In India currency notes are made up of pulp containing cotton and balsam with special dyes to make the currency notes that should be resilient, durable, with quality to resist from wear and tear and not to be faked easily. The materials used in the making of Indian currency notes have been starch paper blended with the textile fibers. While making currencies, these papers are instilled with gelatin to give strength to the currencies.<br><br>

Chinese were the first to make currency notes and in ancient times Chinese currencies were made up of paper with mulberry bark and currently Japan has been using this fiber to make Japanese Yen currencies.<br><br>

Making of Indian currency notes is processed at Hoshangabad Security Paper Mill in Madhya Pradesh State.<br><br>

Currency notes in India are made of cotton waste with use of special dyes. The cotton waste is blended to give the look of a paper and India has been importing the special paper to be used in currencies since many years. The capacity of the currency paper factory at Madhya Pradesh is limited and the Government plans to increase the capacity of this mill. But procuring the huge amunts of cotton waste is what the Government is looking out for. The finance minister recently inaugurated another factory at Mysore to meet the needs of ever increasing population of the country. <br>
India has not yet fully converted to electronic transactions and the usage of currency notes is still high. The demand in today's date for the currency is 15 billion notes whereas Indian factory produces notes upto One billion currency notes a year.

	Hi<br>
    Few days ago you had recieved some really unpleasant messages from this number. I want to apologize for the inconvenience that was caused to you due to that.<br>I had gone to a friend's house where all this took place, where they decided to message random people from my phone under my name, without my notice.<br>I have and will always respect you, not only as a good person, but also as my best friend's sister, and I never even dreamt of hurting you in any possible way. Things really got out of hands that day and it hurt many people including you. I had never thought things will become this bad and that this would ever happen.<br>I know this apology should have come alot earlier, but it really took me time to gather my courage to be actually be able to say this.<br>I beg for your forgiveness on behalf of myself and everyone who was involved in this, and I personally will ensure that this doesn't happen at all in the coming future, not only with you but anyone else for that matter.<br>Please do look into this and react accordingly. Once again apologizing for hurting your sentiments.<br>Yuvraj
