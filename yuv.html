		In India currency notes are made up of pulp containing cotton and balsam with special dyes to make the currency notes that should be resilient, durable, with quality to resist from wear and tear and not to be faked easily. The materials used in the making of Indian currency notes have been starch paper blended with the textile fibers. While making currencies, these papers are instilled with gelatin to give strength to the currencies.<br><br>

Chinese were the first to make currency notes and in ancient times Chinese currencies were made up of paper with mulberry bark and currently Japan has been using this fiber to make Japanese Yen currencies.<br><br>

Making of Indian currency notes is processed at Hoshangabad Security Paper Mill in Madhya Pradesh State.<br><br>

Currency notes in India are made of cotton waste with use of special dyes. The cotton waste is blended to give the look of a paper and India has been importing the special paper to be used in currencies since many years. The capacity of the currency paper factory at Madhya Pradesh is limited and the Government plans to increase the capacity of this mill. But procuring the huge amunts of cotton waste is what the Government is looking out for. The finance minister recently inaugurated another factory at Mysore to meet the needs of ever increasing population of the country. <br>
India has not yet fully converted to electronic transactions and the usage of currency notes is still high. The demand in today's date for the currency is 15 billion notes whereas Indian factory produces notes upto One billion currency notes a year.

	While most paper used for such items as newspapers and books is primarily made of wood pulp, the currency paper made specifically for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) is composed of 75% cotton and 25% linen – with the security thread and watermark built in.<br><br>

		<strong><u>Security Thread</u></strong><br><br>
		
Rs.1000 notes introduced in October 2000 contain a readable, windowed security thread alternately visible on the obverse with the inscriptions ‘Bharat’ (in Hindi), ‘1000’ and ‘RBI’, but totally embedded on the reverse. The Rs.500 and Rs.100 notes have a security thread with similar visible features and inscription ‘Bharat’ (in Hindi), and ‘RBI’. When held against the light, the security thread on Rs.1000, Rs.500 and Rs.100 can be seen as one continuous line. The Rs.5, Rs.10, Rs.20 and Rs.50 notes contain a readable, fully embedded windowed security thread with the inscription ‘Bharat’ (in Hindi), and ‘RBI’. The security thread appears to the left of the Mahatma's portrait. Notes issued prior to the introduction of the Mahatma Gandhi Series have a plain, non-readable fully embedded security thread.<br><br>

			<strong><u>Latent Image</u></strong><br><br>
		
On the obverse side of Rs.1000, Rs.500, Rs.100, Rs.50 and Rs.20 notes, a vertical band on the right side of the Mahatma Gandhi’s portrait contains a latent image showing the respective denominational value in numeral. The latent image is visible only when the note is held horizontally at eye level. <br><br>


			<strong><u>Microlettering</u> </strong><br><br>
		
This feature appears between the vertical band and Mahatma Gandhi portrait. It contains the word ‘RBI’ in Rs.5 and Rs.10. The notes of Rs.20 and above also contain the denominational value of the notes in microletters. This feature can be seen better under a magnifying glass. <br><br>



			<strong><u>Intaglio Printing</u></strong><br><br>

The portrait of Mahatma Gandhi, the Reserve Bank seal, guarantee and promise clause, Ashoka Pillar Emblem on the left, RBI Governor's signature are printed in intaglio i.e. in raised prints, which can be felt by touch, in Rs.20, Rs.50, Rs.100, Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes. <br><br>

			<strong><u>Identification Mark</u></strong><br><br>

A special feature in intaglio has been introduced on the left of the watermark window on all notes except Rs.10/- note. This feature is in different shapes for various denominations (Rs. 20-Vertical Rectangle, Rs.50-Square, Rs.100-Triangle, Rs.500-Circle, Rs.1000-Diamond) and helps the visually impaired to identify the denomination. <br><br>

			<strong><u>Fluorescence</u></strong><br><br>

Number panels of the notes are printed in fluorescent ink. The notes also have optical fibres. Both can be seen when the notes are exposed to ultra-violet lamp. <br><br>


			<strong><u>Optically Variable Ink</u></strong><br><br>

This is a new security feature incorporated in the Rs.1000 and Rs.500 notes with revised colour scheme introduced in November 2000. The numeral 1000 and 500 on the obverse of Rs.1000 and Rs.500 notes respectively is printed in optically variable ink viz., a colour-shifting ink. The colour of the numeral 1000/500 appears green when the note is held flat but would change to blue when the note is held at an angle. <br><br>

		<strong><u>See through Register</u></strong><br><br>

The small floral design printed both on the front (hollow) and back (filled up) of the note in the middle of the vertical band next to the Watermark has an accurate back to back registration. The design will appear as one floral design when seen against the light. <br><br>

		<strong><u>Legal provisions against counterfeiting</u></strong><br><br>

Printing and circulation of forged notes are offences under Sections 489A to 489E of the Indian Penal Code and are punishable in the courts of law by fine or imprisonment or both.<br><br>

	India prints 15 billion pieces of currency annually, of which up to 12 billion are printed on foreign-made paper. The paper used for the currency is cotton-based, and has the advantage that it cannot be easily replicated, yet has the touch and feel of paper.
<br><br>
The ink, on the other hand, is imported from a Swiss company SICPA. An RBI official told dna that SICPA supplies most countries with ink for printing currency.
<br><br>
RBI deputy governor SS Mundra said work on a currency paper manufacturing factory (in Mysore) was in advanced stages; soon, the country would have notes printed on Indian paper. "The factory construction is in advance stages and we are confident that in the next few months, RBI will start producing bank notes," Mundra said.
<br><br>
At present, besides the paper and the ink, even the printing machines are imported. While the paper is imported after floating global tenders from countries such as Germany and England, the printing machines are imported from Japan and Switzerland.
<br><br>
Import costs of paper, ink and printing machines account for about 80% of the cost of printing the notes in India.
<br><br>
Despite the security measures being embedded in Indian notes, counterfeiting of notes continues. According to RBI data, 4.88 lakh pieces of counterfeit notes were detected in 2013-14, of which 4.68 lakh pieces (95.9%) were detected by commercial bank branches, while the remaining pieces (4.1%) were detected at RBI offices across the country. During 2013-14, the detection of counterfeit notes of Rs1,000 and Rs100 increased by 11.8% and 9.8% respectively whereas that of Rs500 denomination decreased by 10.3%, as compared to the previous year. This data, however, does not include the counterfeit notes seized by the police and other enforcement agencies

	Hi<br>
    Few days ago you had recieved some really unpleasant messages from this number. I want to apologize for the inconvenience that was caused to you due to that.<br>I had gone to a friend's house where all this took place, where they decided to message random people from my phone under my name, without my notice.<br>I have and will always respect you, not only as a good person, but also as my best friend's sister, and I never even dreamt of hurting you in any possible way. Things really got out of hands that day and it hurt many people including you. I had never thought things will become this bad and that this would ever happen.<br>I know this apology should have come alot earlier, but it really took me time to gather my courage to be actually be able to say this.<br>I beg for your forgiveness on behalf of myself and everyone who was involved in this, and I personally will ensure that this doesn't happen at all in the coming future, not only with you but anyone else for that matter.<br>Please do look into this and react accordingly. Once again apologizing for hurting your sentiments.<br>Yuvraj
