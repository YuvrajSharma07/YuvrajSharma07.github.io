	<p><strong>About</strong><br><br>
		Yoga is essentially a spiritual discipline based on an extremely subtle science, which focuses on bringing harmony between mind and body. It is an art and scince of healthy living.<u> The word ‘Yoga’ is derived from the Sanskrit root ‘Yuj’, meaning ‘to join’ or ‘to yoke’ or ‘to unite’.</u> As per Yogic scriptures the practice of Yoga leads to the union of individual consciousness with that of the Universal Consciousness, indicating a perfect harmony between the mind and body, Man & Nature. According to modern scientists, everything in the universe is just a manifestation of the same quantum firmament. One who experiences this oneness of existence is said to be in yoga, and is termed as a yogi, having attained to a state of freedom referred to as mukti, nirvana or moksha. Thus <u>the aim of Yoga is Self-realization, to overcome all kinds of sufferings leading to 'the state of liberation' (Moksha) or ‘freedom’ (Kaivalya).</u> Living with freedom in all walks of life, health and harmony shall be the main objectives of Yoga practice."Yoga” also refers to an inner science comprising of a variety of methods through which human beings can realize this union and achieve mastery over their destiny.Yoga, being widely considered as an ‘immortal cultural outcome’ of Indus Saraswati Valley civilization – dating back to 2700 B.C., has proved itself catering to both material and spiritual upliftment of humanity.Basic humane values are the very identity of Yoga Sadhana.<br><br><strong>Origin</strong><br><br>
		<u>Several thousand years ago, on the banks of the lake Kantisarovar in the Himalayas, Adiyogi poured his profound knowledge into the legendary Saptarishis or "seven sages”. The sages carried this powerful yogic science to different parts of the world</u>, including Asia, the Middle East, Northern Africa and South America. Interestingly, modern scholars have noted and marvelled at the close parallels found between ancient cultures across the globe. However, it was in India that the yogic system found its fullest expression. Agastya, the Saptarishi who travelled across the Indian subcontinent, crafted this culture around a core yogic way of life.<br><br><strong>Practice</strong><br><br><u>Yogic Practices for Health and Wellness:The widely practiced Yoga Sadhanas (Practices) are: Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana (Meditation), Samadhi /Samyama, Bandhas & Mudras, Shat-karmas</u>, Yukta-ahara, Yukta karma, Mantra japa, etc.Yama's are restraints and Niyama's are observances. These are considered to be pre-requisits for the Yoga Sadhanas (Practices). Asanas, capable of bringing about stability of body and mind ‘ kuryat-tad-asanam-sthairyam...’ , consists in adopting various body (psycho-physical) patterns, giving ability to maintain a body position (a stable awareness of one’s structural existence) for a considerable length and period of time as well.

	Hi<br>
    Few days ago you had recieved some really unpleasant messages from this number. I want to apologize for the inconvenience that was caused to you due to that.<br>I had gone to a friend's house where all this took place, where they decided to message random people from my phone under my name, without my notice.<br>I have and will always respect you, not only as a good person, but also as my best friend's sister, and I never even dreamt of hurting you in any possible way. Things really got out of hands that day and it hurt many people including you. I had never thought things will become this bad and that this would ever happen.<br>I know this apology should have come alot earlier, but it really took me time to gather my courage to be actually be able to say this.<br>I beg for your forgiveness on behalf of myself and everyone who was involved in this, and I personally will ensure that this doesn't happen at all in the coming future, not only with you but anyone else for that matter.<br>Please do look into this and react accordingly. Once again apologizing for hurting your sentiments.<br>Yuvraj
