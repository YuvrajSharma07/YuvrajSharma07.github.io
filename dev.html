	<p><strong>Lohri</strong>
	Lohri is a popular winter time Punjabi folk festival, celebrated primarily by Sikhs and Hindus from the Punjab region of Indian subcontinent. Lohri is celebrated with a bonfire. The lighting of bonfire during this winter festival is an ancient tradition. In Punjab, the harvest festival Lohri is marked by eating sheaves of roasted corn from the new harvest. Sugarcane products such as gurh and gachak are central to Lohri celebrations, as are nuts which are harvested in January.
