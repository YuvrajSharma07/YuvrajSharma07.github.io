	<p><strong>Chhath Puja</strong><br><br>
		 The Chhath Puja is dedicated to the Sun and his wife Usha. The rituals of the festival are rigorous and are observed over a period of four days. They include holy bathing, fasting and abstaining from drinking water (Barta), standing in water for long periods of time, and offering prashad (prayer offerings) and arghya to the setting and rising sun.

	<p><strong>Extinct species</strong><br><br>
		<strong>West African Black Rhino</strong><br><br>
		The West African black rhinoceros was a subspecies of the black rhino that was declared extinct in 2011.<br><br><strong>Reason:</strong> poaching and demand for rhino horn.<br><br>
		<strong>Caribbean Monk Seal</strong><br><br>
		Last seen in the early 1950s, the Caribbean monk seal was declared extinct in 2008 after a five-year review by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service.<br><br><strong>Reason:</strong> The seals had been hunted by European explorers. They were later exploited for their fur, meat and oil by fisherman and whalers.

	<p><strong>Endangered species</strong><br><br>
		<strong>Tiger</strong><br><br>
		Probably fewer than 4,000 are left in the wild. In 2014, China explicitly outlawed the consumption of endangered species, including tigers, whose bones, and other organs are superstitiously believed to have magical curative powers.<br><br><strong>Reason:</strong> Slash-and-burn agriculture, along with logging, and human encroachment, have hugely diminished the habitat available to these felines, poaching — for trophies and body parts used in Asian “medicine”.<br><br>
		<strong>Giant Panda</strong><br><br>
		They’re known as “charismatic megafauna” for a reason. These endangered animals ooze star power, a factor that conservationists have capitalized on in order to fund projects to protect them.<br><br><strong>Reason:</strong> Poaching for skin and fur.<br><br>

	<p><strong>Vulnerable species</strong><br><br>
	A vulnerable species is one which has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as likely to become endangered unless the circumstances threatening its survival and reproduction improve.<br><br>
